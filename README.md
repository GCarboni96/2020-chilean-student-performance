# Chilean Student Performance

## Requirements

## Run instructions

## Overview

The goal of the project is to explore and analyze two datasets that are closely related: student's performance and teacher's evaluation. Specifically, we want to know if there is any correlation between these results, in order to confirm if there is any influence from the teacher's performance on the final grades of the students. We would also like to compare the results depending on their region, commune, etc....

## Dataset

We use two datasets from the Ministry of Education of the Government of Chile: Academic Performance and Professor Evaluation. These can be found on the following links:

+ [Academic Performance](http://datos.mineduc.cl/dashboards/19881/rendimiento-academico-por-estudiantes/).

+ [Professor Evaluation](http://datos.mineduc.cl/dashboards/19754/bases-de-datos-de-evaluacion-docente/).

|     | Academic performance | Professor evaluation |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| Attributes | 42 | 39 |
| Number of registers | 57.950.225 | 106.650 |
| Size in bytes | 7.45 GB | 115 MB |

## Methods

Both datasets were proccesed using the analytis engine Apache Spark. Specifically, we built our project using Apache Maven and programmed the queries with the language Scala.

For both datasets, we only picked the colums of interest via a column picker method (*EvaluationDataset* and *Performance Dataset*), since most of the information would not be used in any significant way. This also makes the general proccessing of data much faster and efficient, and we can also pick data from any year range we want.

In order to run our queries, the Driver class needs to be executed, which is in charge of starting the Spark session and run the queries contained in the rest of the scala files.  Inside these classes, we first run the column picker method corresponding to the dataset and we inmediately filter the results with null values inside their columns.

Once the dataframe is filtered, we turn it into an RDD which is used to execute the MapReduce operations we need to obtain the desired information. After this, the RDD is turned back into a dataframe and finally its contents are saved on a csv file.

The classes/queries we used are the following:

* *Driver*: The main class that initializes the spark session and runs the rest of the classes.

* *EvaluationDataset*: Class that has column picker method to pick specific columns from the teacher dataset (2013-2018).
* *PerformanceDataset*: Class that has column picker method to pick specific columns from the student dataset (2002-2019).
* *PerformanceDatasetForCross*: Same as *PerformanceDataset* but between the years 2013 to 2018.

* *EvaluationStats*: Returns the % distribution by year of the teacher dataset.
* *PerformanceStats*: Returns the % distribution by year of the student dataset.

* *EvaluationYearlyAverage*: Returns the average teacher grade and classification of each school by year.
* *EvaluationYearlyRegion*: Returns the average teacher grade and classification of each region by year.
* *EvaluationYearlyMetroComuna*: Returns the average teacher grade and classification of each commune of Santiago by year.

* *PerformanceYearlyAverage*: Returns the average student grade and assistance of each school by year.
* *PerformanceYearlyAverageByGender*: Returns the average student grade and assistance of each school by year splitted by gender.
* *PerformanceYearlyAverageByYear*: Returns the average student grade and assistance by year.

* *EvaluationAndPerformanceYearlyAverageRegion*: Returns the average teacher grade and student grade of each region by year.
* *EvaluationAndPerformanceYearlyAverageMetroComuna*: Returns average teacher grade and student grade of each commune of Santiago by year.

Finally, we studied our results by making graphs via Matplotlib and Seaborn, Python libraries specialized for visualizations.


## Results

After coding the queries, their respective results were generated and were studied using the graphs generated by Matplotlib. The next images correspond to the most interesting results.

**Annual distribution of student performance**

**Annual distribution of teacher evaluation**

**Annual student reprobation by dependency**
![Reprobacion Anual segun dependencia](https://i.imgur.com/sB46fNB.png)

The reprobation rate starts to drop from the year 2010-2012, and you can see certain peaks on the years 2006 and 2011, probably caused by the student's strikes of those years.

**Annual student reprobation by rurality**
![Reprobacion anual segun tipo de localidad](https://i.imgur.com/890X2uu.png)

There starts to be more reprobation on the urban schools since 2009 and the effect of the strikes do not increase the rural reprobation.

**Student's performance and assistance by school (2018)**
![Rendimiento alumnos y su asistencia por establecimiento (2018)](https://i.imgur.com/lzM9lBU.png)

There seems to be a certain clustering between 80% and 100% assitance and 5 to 6.5 in student performance, which is expected.

**Student's yearly performance by gender (difference)**
![Rendimiento alumnos por año](https://i.imgur.com/ZAVYRpQ.png)

In all years, female students tend to have a slightly better performance with a margin of 0.2.

**Student's yearly assistance**
![Asistencia alumnos por año](https://i.imgur.com/K0IQ02C.png)

Most of this data is uniform, except for the year 2011.

**Student's yearly performance**
![Rendimiento alumnos por año](https://i.imgur.com/tOaS1s0.png)

There seems to be a considerable increase each year.


**Teacher's grades by school**
![Cantidad clasificaciones docentes por establecimiento](https://i.imgur.com/slKR7dR.png)

The amount of teachers graded as Competente and Destacado increases each year, except for the last year, where it decreases suddenly (maybe the way of evaluation changed)

**Teacher's grades by commune of Santiago**
![Cantidad clasificaciones docentes por comuna de Santiago](https://i.imgur.com/k5Usd9q.png)

**Student's performance and teacher's evaluation by region (2017)**
![Rendimiento alumnos y docentes por region (2017)](https://i.imgur.com/mATReIf.png)

There seems to be more uniformity on the student's grades than the teacher's, but not so much.

**Student's performance and teacher's evaluation by commune of Santiago (2013 vs 2017)**
![Rendimiento alumnos y docentes en Santiago (2013 vs 2017)](https://i.imgur.com/UUi9FsZ.jpg)

There is a significant increase on both indicators from 2013 to 2018. However, the top 5 communes with the highest scores mantain their relative position in comparison to the rest of Santiago.



## Conclusion

One of the most important things to consider before doing or programming is to analyze the data you're working with, and define the exact information you're interested in. In our case, we programmed a lot of queries that we didn't really need because they didn't offer significant results in the end, which is why it could have been really convenient to know the exact variables we were interested in.

Also, it is very important to know tools such as Spark if you want to work and study data of higher magnitudes or sizes.
