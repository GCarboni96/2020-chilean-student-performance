## Overview

The goal of the project is to explore and analyze two datasets that are closely related: student's performance and teacher's evaluation. Specifically, we want to know if there is any correlation between these results, in order to confirm if there is any influence from the teacher's performance on the final grades of the students. We would also like to compare the results depending on their region, commune, etc....
